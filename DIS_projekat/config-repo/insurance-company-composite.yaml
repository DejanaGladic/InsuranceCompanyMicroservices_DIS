    create-composite-product:
      description: Creates a composite insurance company
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        The composite insurance company information posted to the API will be splitted up and stored as separate insurance company-info, employee, insurance offer and transaction entities.
        # Expected error responses
        1. If a insurance company with the same insuranceCompanyId as specified in the posted information already exists,
           an <b>422 - Unprocessable Entity</b> error with a "duplicate key" error message will be returned
    delete-composite-product:
      description: Deletes a insurance company composite
      notes: |
        # Normal response
        Entities for insurance company information, employees, insurance offers and transactions related to the specificed insuranceCompanyId will be deleted.
        The implementation of the delete method is idempotent, i.e. it can be called several times with the same response.
        This means that a delete request of a non existing insurance company will return <b>200 Ok</b>.
